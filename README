It is a django web app and acts as an example for interacting with ClipCloud.

  > Provide a callback hook to allow ClipCloud to send a RequestToken back to you.
  > Process a RequestToken and allow your User to request an AccessToken.
  > Store Access/Request Tokens for your users.
  > Send data to ClipCloud.
  > Request user data from ClipCloud.
